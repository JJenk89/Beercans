## Overview

This is a simple homepage for a (fictional) pub along with a web form with simple validation and a success message popup. It is fully responsive and was designed and built from scratch.

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid & Flexbox
-   JavaScript
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first "finished" frontend website I've made. I began work on it late last year and it has taught me a lot about the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In particular I've learnt a lot about all the things you see on the page: menus, galleries, and web forms.

It has also taught me how to handle browser specific issues in CSS as I noticed a bug in Firefox when using smooth scrolling and anchor tags.
